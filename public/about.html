<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Timmothy Luong</strong>, and I recently graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I’m passionate about working in the technology industry, where I can bring together creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration to make a meaningful impact. 
My long-term goal is to become a Product Manager, but I’m also deeply interested in web development and enjoy learning how to build thoughtful products that bring value and happiness to people.</p>

<p>As a first-generation college graduate, I’m driven by curiosity, empathy, and the desire to create opportunities not only for myself but also for those around me. 
I’m excited to continue growing in the field of product and project management, where I can collaborate with diverse teams, apply design thinking, and bridge the gap between business and technology through hands-on experience.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love playing competitive volleyball and traveling the world with friends. 
I’m a people person who values every connection I make and thrives in team environments where everyone works toward a shared goal.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I have an arm tattoo dedicated to my hometown, San Francisco! 
It features iconic landmarks like the Chinatown Gate, Golden Gate Bridge, Sutro Tower, Transamerica Pyramid, Bay Bridge, Japantown, and even a cable car — a tribute to the city that shaped who I am today.</p>
